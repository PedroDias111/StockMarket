# Stock Market App

**Stock Market App** is an Android application provides comprehensive insights into various publicly traded companies. Leveraging the **Alpha Vantage API**, the app fetches a list of companies, allowing users to select any company for detailed information.
This app was my first project involving **Retrofit**, **Room**, and **Dagger Hilt** for dependency injection. Building this application enhanced my understanding of API interactions, data persistence, and architecture in Android development.

### Key Features:
- **Company Listings**: Browse a list of publicly traded companies with relevant data.
- **Detailed Company Information**: Access extensive details for each selected company, including the latest market performance.
- **Graphical Representation**: Intraday performance is visually represented through graphs, enabling users to analyze trends effectively.
